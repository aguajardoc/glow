This Discord Bot is designed to make ICPC training more directed towards the unpredictable environment in which ICPC contests take place. Problems are essentially random, so one's training should be too. Of course, fetching a random problem from every contest ever created is not viable, as people might get problems way outside their skill level which, while true to ICPC, this does not promote one's competitive programming skills. As such, a rating system is in place to combat this, allowing players to practice with problems in their comfort zone, encouraging them to try *slightly* harder problems once in a while.

This project is a work in progress. The main functionality is finished, but many, many things are still missing for this to be considerd a complete package.
