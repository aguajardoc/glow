// A different mode of training: allows a user to train progressively harder problems starting from a set difficulty.
// For example, a user can start at difficulty 3, solve it, and go up to 4,and so on.
// Keep statistics like time taken, problems solved, and reached difficulty for self-comparison and leaderboards.
