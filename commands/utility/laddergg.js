// Ladder gitgudders: intended to be a separate leaderboard from gitgud activities for active comparison between users.
// Instead of point count, sort users by their best difficulty solved and time taken.
// Requirements: 
// - Leaderboard should only include people who started from difficulty 1, to keep things fair.
// - Be able to fetch data for periods of time: weekly, monthly, yearly, all time.
// - Show the leaderboard in an image format, similar to the original gitgudder leaderboard.
